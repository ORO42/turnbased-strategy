Attack Ability Logic
    1. Select unit
    2. Hover target
    3. If any obstacles in path of target that are impenetrable, cannot attack, else if projectile overrides impenetrable
    4. If projectile causes explosion, check if LOS / destroy impenetrable LOS blocker in same frame and deal damage

Penetration Alternative:
    1. If colliding with unit/obstacle, use unit/obstacle's stopChance
    2. If colliding with destination position, stop chance = 100
    3. Roll stop chance
